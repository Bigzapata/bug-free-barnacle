# Description: This is a webpage I created for my substance abuse counselors biographies to be posted so that anyone wanting help can see if there is anyone that a person # with a drug problem can see if there is anyone compatable with them. Also we are trying to raise money for the boy's home we are trying to open up for troubled teens 
# that have gotten in trouble with the law. Our program would be a residental home that houses between 6 to 8 minors, that are facing jail time for crimes commited with   # firearms. We are all ex-gang members that turned our life around and now we are trying to give back to our communities by working with kids needing a male figure in    # their lives. Our plan is to offer substance abuse counseling, GED preparation, coping skills, anger management, parenting classes, community services, and computer     # coding. You can learn more about it once we put up the details.
